Fedify changelog
================

Version 1.8.1
-------------

To be released.  Note that 1.8.0 was skipped due to a mistake in
the versioning.

 -  The repository has been restructured as a monorepo, consolidating all
    Fedify packages into a single repository with unified versioning.  This
    change affects the following packages:

     -  `@fedify/fedify` (main library)
     -  `@fedify/cli` (CLI toolchain)
     -  `@fedify/amqp` (AMQP/RabbitMQ driver)
     -  `@fedify/express` (Express integration)
     -  `@fedify/h3` (h3 framework integration)
     -  `@fedify/postgres` (PostgreSQL drivers)
     -  `@fedify/redis` (Redis drivers)

    All packages now follow the same version number and are released together.
    Previously, each package had independent versioning.

 -  Key–value stores now optionally support CAS (compare-and-swap) operation
    for atomic updates.  This is useful for implementing optimistic locking
    and preventing lost updates in concurrent environments.

     -  Added optional `KvStore.cas()` method.
     -  Added `MemoryKvStore.cas()` method.
     -  Added `DenoKvStore.cas()` method.

 -  Added options to customize the temporary actor information when running
    `fedify inbox` command.  [[#262], [#285] by Hasang Cho]

     -  Added `--actor-name` option to customize the actor display name.
     -  Added `--actor-summary` option to customize the actor description.
     -  Both options provide sensible defaults when not specified.

 -  Added useful functions for fediverse handles at `@fedify/fedify/vocab`.
    This functions simplify working with fediverse handles and URLs.
    [[#278] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  `FediverseHandle`: An interface representing a fediverse handle.
     -  `parseFediverseHandle()`: A function to parse a fediverse handle into
        its components.
     -  `isFediverseHandle()`: A function to check if a string is a valid
        fediverse handle.
     -  `toAcctUrl()`: A function to convert a fediverse handle to a `URL`.

 -  Added `LookupWebFingerOptions.maxRedirection` option.
    [[#248], [#281] by Lee ByeongJun]

 -  Optimized `doubleKnock()` function to avoid multiple request body clones
    during redirects.  The request body is now read once and reused throughout
    the entire operation, preventing potential `TypeError: unusable` errors
    and improving performance.  [[#300] by Fabien O'Carroll]

     -  Added `SignRequestOptions.body` option.
     -  Added `DoubleKnockOptions.body` option.
     -  Updated internal signing functions to accept pre-read body buffers.

 -  Added `fedify webfinger` command. This command allows users to look up
    WebFinger information for a given resource.
    [[#260], [#278] by ChanHaeng Lee]

     -  The input can be a handle (e.g., `@user@server`, `user@server`) or
        a URL (e.g., `https://server/users/path`).
     -  The `--user-agent` or `-a` option used as `User-Agent` header value
        in the WebFinger request.
     -  The `--allow-private-address` or `-p` option allows looking up
        WebFinger information for private addresses (e.g., `localhost`).

  -  Added `--dry-run` option to `fedify init` command.  This option allows users
    to preview what files and configurations would be created without actually
    creating them.  [[#263], [#298] by Lee ByeongJun]

  -  Fixed a bug where the `fedify node` command had failed to correctly
     render the favicon in terminal emulators that do not support 24-bit
     colors.  [[#168], [#282], [#304] by Hyeonseo Kim]

  -  Supported NestJS integration with the `@fedify/nestjs` package.
     [[#269], [#309] by Jaeyeol Lee]

     -  Added `@fedify/nestjs` package.
     -  Added `FedifyModule` for integrating Fedify into NestJS applications.

Version 1.7.6
-------------

Released on July 24, 2025.

 -  Fixed `doubleKnock()` to properly handle redirects with path-only `Location`
    headers by resolving them relative to the original request URL.
    [[#324] by Fabien O'Carroll]


Version 1.7.5
-------------

Released on July 15, 2025.

 -  Fixed `TypeError: unusable` error that occurred when `doubleKnock()`
    encountered redirects during HTTP signature retry attempts.
    [[#294], [#295]]


Version 1.7.4
-------------

Released on July 13, 2025.

  - Fixed a bug the `-T`/`--no-tunnel` option in the `fedify inbox` command
    was being ignored, causing the server to always create a public tunnel
    regardless of the flag. [[#243], [#284] by Lee ByeongJun]

[#243]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/issues/243
[#284]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/284


Version 1.7.3
-------------

Released on July 9, 2025.

 -  Added `"default"` export conditions to all package exports in
    *package.json* for improved Node.js compatibility.


Version 1.7.2
-------------

Released on July 2, 2025.

 -  Fixed HTTP signature verification to handle malformed RFC 9421 signatures
    gracefully instead of returning `500 Internal Server Error` responses.
    Malformed signatures now properly fail verification and return appropriate
    error responses.


Version 1.7.1
-------------

Released on June 30, 2025.

 -  Fixed JSON-LD serialization of the `Question.voters` property to correctly
    serialize as a plain number (e.g., `"votersCount": 123`) instead of as a
    typed literal object (e.g., `"votersCount":{"type":"xsd:nonNegativeInteger",
    "@value":123}`).


Version 1.7.0
-------------

Released on June 25, 2025.

 -  Added optional `MessageQueue.nativeRetrial` property to indicate whether
    the message queue backend provides native retry mechanisms.  When `true`,
    Fedify will skip its own retry logic and rely on the backend to handle
    retries.  When `false` or omitted, Fedify will handle retries using its
    own retry policies.  [[#250], [#251]]

     -  `DenoKvMessageQueue.nativeRetrial` is `true`.
     -  `WorkersMessageQueue.nativeRetrial` is `true`.
     -  `InProcessMessageQueue.nativeRetrial` is `false`.
     -  `ParallelMessageQueue.nativeRetrial` inherits from the wrapped queue.

 -  Added `FederationOptions.firstKnock` option to configure the HTTP
    Signatures specification used for the first signature attempt when
    communicating with unknown servers.  This implements the [double-knocking]
    mechanism for better compatibility across different ActivityPub servers.
    Defaults to `"rfc9421"` (RFC 9421: HTTP Message Signatures), with fallback
    to `"draft-cavage-http-signatures-12"` if the first attempt fails.

    "@value":123}`).


Version 1.6.2
-------------

Released on June 19, 2025.

 -  Fixed compatibility issue with Mastodon servers running bleeding-edge
    versions with RFC 9421 implementation bugs. Extended double-knocking
    to retry with draft-cavage-http-signatures-12 on `5xx` errors as a temporary
    workaround for Mastodon's RFC 9421 implementation that returns `500
    Internal Server Error`.

Version 1.5.4
-------------

Released on June 30, 2025.

 -  Fixed JSON-LD serialization of the `Question.voters` property to correctly
    serialize as a plain number (e.g., `"votersCount": 123`) instead of as a
    typed literal object (e.g., `"votersCount":{"type":"xsd:nonNegativeInteger",
    "@value":123}`).


Version 1.5.3
-------------

Released on May 16, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where inbox handler had thrown a `jsonld.SyntaxError` which
    caused a `500 Internal Server Error` when the received activity had
    an invalid JSON-LD syntax.  Now it logs the error and responds with
    a `400 Bad Request` error instead.  [[#232]]

 -  The `exportJwk()` function now populates the `alg` property of a returned
    `JsonWebKey` object with `"Ed25519"` if the input key is an Ed25519 key.


Version 1.5.2
-------------

Released on May 11, 2025.

Version 1.5.1
-------------

Released on April 8, 2025.

 -  Activity Vocabulary API became to accept [RFC 3339] date-time strings
    without a timezone offset.  This is not a bug fix, but improves
    interoperability with some implementations that do not include a timezone
    offset in their date-time strings including WordPress.  [[#226]]

 -  Added the following default context to `Undo` class:

    ~~~~ json
    {
      "litepub": "http://litepub.social/ns#",
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "EmojiReact": "litepub:EmojiReact",
      "Emoji": "toot:Emoji"
    }
    ~~~~


Version 1.5.0
-------------

Released on March 28, 2025.

-  Improved activity delivery performance with large audiences through
   a two-stage queuing system.  Sending activities to many recipients
   (e.g., accounts with many followers) is now significantly faster and uses
   less memory. [[#220]]

     -  Added `FederationQueueOptions.fanout` option.
     -  Changed the type of `FederationStartQueueOptions.queue` option to
        `"inbox" | "outbox" | "fanout" | undefined` (was `"inbox" | "outbox" |
        undefined`).
     -  Added `SendActivityOptions.fanout` option.
     -  Added OpenTelemetry instrumented span `activitypub.fanout`.
     -  The `ForwardActivityOptions` interface became a type alias of
        `Omit<SendActivityOptions, "fanout"> & { skipIfUnsigned: boolean }`,
        which is still compatible with the previous version.

 -  A `Federation` object now can have a canonical origin for web URLs and
    a canonical host for fediverse handles.  This affects the URLs constructed
    by `Context` objects, and the WebFinger responses.

     -  Added `CreateFederationOptions.origin` option.
     -  Added `FederationOrigin` interface.
     -  Added `Context.canonicalOrigin` property.

 -  Followers collection synchronization ([FEP-8fcf]) is now turned off by
    default.

     -  Added `SendActivityOptionsForCollection` interface.
     -  The type of `Context.sendActivity({ identifier: string } | { username:
        string } | { handle: string }, "followers", Activity)` overload's
        fourth parameter became `SendActivityOptionsForCollection | undefined`
        (was `SendActivityOptions | undefined`).

 -  Fedify now accepts PEM-PKCS#1 besides PEM-SPKI for RSA public keys.
    [[#209]]

     -  `CryptographicKey` now can contain a `publicKey` with a PEM-PKCS#1
        format (in addition to PEM-SPKI).
     -  Added `importPkcs1()` function.
     -  Added `importPem()` function.

 -  The `fetchKey()` function became to choose the public key of the actor
    if `keyId` has no fragment and the actor has only one public key.  [[#211]]

 -  Added an optional parameter with `GetSignedKeyOptions` type to
    the `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` method.

 -  Added `GetSignedKeyOptions` interface.

 -  Added an optional parameter with `GetKeyOwnerOptions` type to
    the `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` method.

 -  Deprecated the parameters of the `AuthorizePredicate` and
    `ObjectAuthorizePredicate` types to get the signed key and its owner
    in favor of the `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` and
    `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` methods.

     -  Deprecated the third parameter of the `AuthorizePredicate` type in favor
        of the `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` method.
     -  Deprecated the fourth parameter of the `AuthorizePredicate` type in
        favor of the `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` method.
     -  Deprecated the third parameter of the `ObjectAuthorizePredicate` type in
        favor of the `RequestContext.getSignedKey()` method.
     -  Deprecated the fourth parameter of the `ObjectAuthorizePredicate` type
        in favor of the `RequestContext.getSignedKeyOwner()` method.

 -  Added an optional method `enqueueMany()` to `MessageQueue` interface
    for sending multiple activities at once.

 -  Updated *@js-temporal/polyfill* to 0.5.0 for Node.js and Bun.  On Deno,
    there is no change because the polyfill is not used.

 -  Updated *uri-template-router* to 0.0.17 which fixes bundler errors on
    Rollup.  [[#221]]

 -  Improved error handling and logging for document loader when KV store
    operations fail.  [[#223] by Revath S Kumar]

 -  Fixed a bug of the `fedify inbox` command where it had failed to render
    the web interface when the `fedify` command was installed using
    `deno install` command from JSR.

 -  The web interface of the `fedify inbox` command was slightly redesigned:

     -  The Fedify logo with the cute dinosaur is now displayed at the top of
        the page.
     -  You can easily copy the fediverse handle of the ephemeral actor.

 -  Internalized the [multibase] package, which is obsolete and no longer
    maintained.  [[#127], [#215] by Fróði Karlsson]

 -  Added more log messages using the [LogTape] library.  Currently the below
    logger categories are used:

     -  `["fedify", "federation", "fanout"]`
     -  `["fedify", "federation", "object"]`

    parameter of the followers collection.  [[#217]]


Version 1.4.6
-------------

Released on March 9, 2025.

 -  Fedify no more depends on `node:punycode` module, which is deprecated in
    Node.js.  Now it uses the built-in `node:url` module instead.
    [[#212], [#214] by Fróði Karlsson]


Version 1.4.5
-------------

Released on February 28, 2025.

 -  Made `fedify init` to install *@fedify/h3* 0.1.2 which is compatible with

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the redirects to the private network addresses, which

    instead of being fully expanded.


Version 1.0.14
--------------

Released on January 21, 2025.

    [[CVE-2025-23221]]

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the infinite number of redirects, which could lead to
        a denial of service attack.  Now it follows up to 5 redirects.

     -  Fixed a security vulnerability where the `lookupWebFinger()` function
        had followed the redirects to other than the HTTP/HTTPS schemes, which

        became `Recipient | Recipient[]` (was `Actor | Actor[]`).  However,
        since `Recipient` is a supertype of `Actor`, the existing code should
        work without any change.

 -  Followers collection now has to consist of `Recipient` objects only.
    (It could consist of `URL`s as well as `Actor`s before.)

     -  The type of `Federation.setFollowersDispatcher()` method's second
        parameter became `CollectionDispatcher<Recipient, TContextData, URL>`
        (was `CollectionDispatcher<Actor | URL, TContextData>`).

        `GetKeyOwnerOptions` (was `DocumentLoader`).
     -  Added `DoesActorOwnKeyOptions` interface.
     -  The type of the third parameter of `doesActorOwnKey()` function became
        `DoesActorOwnKeyOptions` (was `DocumentLoader`).

    logger categories are used:

     -  `["fedify", "federation", "collection"]`
     -  `["fedify", "httpsig", "verify"]`

    object when WebFinger response had no links with
    `"type": "application/activity+json"` but had `"type":
    "application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\""`.
